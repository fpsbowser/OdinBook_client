# OdinBook Client

Check out the OdinBook client [here](https://odinbook-client-e9jw.onrender.com/)!

### Summary

This is my final project for [theodinproject](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-odin-book) Node.js curriculum. The goal of this project was to build a full-stack application completely from scratch. This project utilizes React for the frontend and MongoDB for the backend. Frontend to backend communications is achieved by a REST API I built using Node.js/Express. Check out the OdinBook API repo [here](https://github.com/fpsbowser/odinbook_api)!

This application is closely modeled after popular social networking apps like Facebook and twitter.
